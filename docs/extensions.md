# Extensions

Extensions are bundled with Core in the `unified-cli` 0.5.4
distribution; `unified_cli` and `unified_cli_ext` are both public namespaces in
that one wheel. Core continues to support Claude, Codex, and Gemini (`agy`) as
its only defaults. Extensions are a feature boundary: using one does not change
those defaults, add an extension to Core's local server allowlist, or install or
configure vendor software.

The bundled extensions provide 18 explicit provider entry points and executable
adapters. Grok is Stable from macOS live verification on 2026-07-23 and
OpenCode is Stable from macOS live verification on 2026-07-24. The other 16
are executable Preview adapters after their official CLI is installed,
authenticated, and configured; Preview means provider-specific E2E has not yet
been verified, not metadata-only or blocked. No Ext provider is enabled in the
public Core `/v1/*` server routes.

Vendor binaries, accounts, subscriptions, and their updates remain
user-owned. Installing Ext alone does not install a vendor CLI, log in, call a
service, or incur charges. Ext is not affiliated with the vendors listed here.

## Install and inspect

```bash
python -m pip install "unified-cli==0.5.4"
python -c "import unified_cli_ext; print(unified_cli_ext.__name__)"
unified-cli providers --include-ext
```

The Python command only confirms that the bundled extension namespace imports.
The `providers` command displays installed entry-point metadata. Neither
verifies a vendor installation, authentication state, or service availability.

Core keeps this discovery import-free. `unified-cli providers --include-ext`
shows Grok/OpenCode as live-verified Stable adapters and the other 16 as
callback-free `discovered`/`preview` entries. An explicit request loads only
that provider's entry point. Python `create()`, CLI, and REPL can run all 18;
browser chat requires a fixed safe read-only mapping and is therefore a
narrower surface. OpenCode browser chat is intentionally unavailable because
its merged remote/system MCP configuration cannot yet be positively disabled;
its Python, CLI, and REPL paths are enabled. Refresh models only when asked:
`unified-cli models PROVIDER --refresh` or REPL `/model --refresh`. If a
provider fails, file sanitized logs/diagnostics in an issue. Ext providers
remain disabled in public `/v1/*` routes.

## Grok Stable setup and boundary

The normal setup is short. `configure` verifies the official executable,
creates the reviewed isolated configuration, and stores a launch receipt. The
vendor's official login can then write to that isolated home:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://x.ai/cli/install.sh | bash
unified-cli configure grok
HOME="$HOME/.unified-cli/providers/grok/home" grok login --device-code
python examples/09_extensions.py grok "Explain this repository"
```

The same flow is available from Python:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from unified_cli import configure_extension_provider, create

configure_extension_provider("grok")
client = create("grok", cwd=str(Path.cwd().resolve()))
print(client.chat("Explain this repository").text)
```

The normal user `~/.grok/auth.json` is never read or copied by the wrapper. If
present with strict owner-only metadata, the official CLI receives its path
through `GROK_AUTH_PATH`; otherwise the isolated login above is used. If login
is missing, Python and the CLI return a sanitized `auth_expired` error.

<details>
<summary>Manual native snapshot verification reference</summary>

The following longer recipe documents the checks performed automatically and
is intended for maintainers auditing the reviewed macOS arm64 snapshot.

Grok Build is a Stable Ext provider. Its primary official
native installer is `https://x.ai/cli/install.sh`; the official npm package
`@xai-official/grok` is a vendor alternative, but this Stable native path uses
the native install layout only. The known unrelated
`@vibe-kit/grok-cli` CLI shape is rejected. The only reviewed version is
`0.2.111`; other versions fail closed. The only verified platform is macOS
arm64. Run the vendor installer in your normal user home, then use the
fail-closed recipe below. It accepts only the native installer's owned,
non-writable `~/.grok` layout, requires its `bin/grok` symlink to resolve
directly to a single-link regular file in `downloads`, verifies the exact
reviewed SHA-256, and copies it into a fresh version/platform-qualified private
snapshot. It also creates the exact safe configuration before any login.
Unsupported OS/architecture, path shape, ownership, link type/count, mode,
digest, or version output is refused:

Do not reuse a generic host login. The single setup invocation creates the
config and copied binary with no-follow exclusive opens, verifies their
single-link regular metadata, fsyncs both, rechecks the copied digest and exact
parsed `0.2.111` version, confirms the login cwd is empty, then `execve`s the
fixed login argv with a minimal fixed environment. It never truncates or
replaces a pre-existing snapshot or config, follows a pre-existing path, uses
shell interpolation, inspects auth contents, or prints credentials. If the
qualified snapshot already exists, setup refuses rather than silently reusing
it; use the already-authenticated snapshot or inspect/remove it manually before
an intentional fresh setup.
After authenticating that snapshot, register the same canonical binary and home
through Core's public extension-configuration API:

```bash
python - <<'PY'
from pathlib import Path
from unified_cli import ExtensionLaunchOverridesV1, configure_extension_provider

root = (
    Path.home()
    / ".unified-cli"
    / "providers"
    / "grok"
    / "native-0.2.111-darwin-arm64"
)
configure_extension_provider(
    "grok",
    ExtensionLaunchOverridesV1(
        bin_path=str(root / "bin" / "grok"),
        provider_home=str(root / "home"),
    ),
)
PY
unified-cli chat "explain this project" --provider grok --model grok-4.5
```

These are copy-only instructions; Ext never runs installation or login itself.
Repeat the snapshot and registration after an intentional vendor CLI update.

For each prompt, the adapter fixes `--no-auto-update`, strict sandboxing,
`dontAsk`, and permits only `read_file`, `grep`, and `list_dir`. Its fixed
process environment disables the updater, write, tool-search, LSP, memory,
subagents, web, and Claude/Cursor/Codex skills, rules, agents, MCPs, hooks, and
sessions, and requires gitignore-aware traversal. Managed MCP and official
marketplace auto-registration are off, and marketplace packages require a SHA;
callers cannot override these controls.
Immediately before every turn it fails closed if it finds
`.grok`, `.envrc`, `.mcp.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json`,
`.cursor/hooks.json`, or `.claude` from the cwd up to the Git root (or at the
cwd only when it is outside a Git repository);
provider-home shell startup files, runtime config (except the exact safe `0600`
template above), plugins, hook directories or hook-path files; or managed
`/etc/grok` configuration. The provider home must be an owned real `0700`
directory; `.grok` must be an owned real directory without group/other write,
and config/auth state must be private regular single-link files. Auth contents
are never parsed by this validation. An otherwise isolated provider `HOME` with
the safe template and vendor runtime state is allowed.

These controls are defense in depth around a read-only Preview, not a complete
secret boundary. Gitignore-aware traversal reduces accidental exposure but does
not make ignored or workspace-readable files secret from the vendor process.

Offline fixtures verify the adapter. A representative isolated device-code
smoke of official native Grok `0.2.111` (commit marker `94172f2aa4e5`) passed on
macOS arm64 on 2026-07-23; its sanitized results are recorded in
[the smoke evidence](development/grok-0.2.111-smoke.md). This is one
version/platform/auth sample, not a release-wide compatibility claim. Grok is
therefore still Preview, not Stable, and remains disabled in public `/v1/*`
server routes.

</details>

## Local installation receipts

Ext can record and later recheck the identity and metadata of an explicitly
selected local executable or npm launcher. A receipt describes local files; it
does not prove who published them or replace verification of the vendor's
official distribution channel. Capture and verification should happen as
close as practical to launch because another process with the same filesystem
access can change a path between those operations.

## Status vocabulary

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Stable | A released, supported integration with the documented compatibility evidence. |
| Preview | An enabled integration still being evaluated; its limits are documented. |

Grok and OpenCode are Stable, live-verified macOS integrations (2026-07-23 and
2026-07-24 respectively). The other 16 catalog entries are executable Preview
adapters attempted when explicitly selected after official CLI
install/auth/configure; they are not catalog-only. Preview does not guarantee
vendor/account compatibility. All Ext public-server policies are disabled, so
public-compatible `/v1/*` routes remain Core-only. The loopback-only
`serve --manage` UI may invoke only the audited browser-safe Ext subset in a
registered workspace through the same Python `create()` path. OpenCode remains
enabled in Python/CLI/REPL but is excluded from browser chat until all inherited
MCP startup can be disabled.

Grok can execute tools while its explicit tool timeline is unavailable.
OpenCode vendors can reject tiny or invalid images. See the
[OpenCode live smoke matrix](development/opencode-go-live-smoke-2026-07-24.md).

## Historical Stage 5B–5F design catalog

“Candidate transport” records a provisional design direction, not a command
contract. This is retained as a pre-0.5.2 design record; its historical Held
and Experimental labels are superseded by the generated support table above.
Every current adapter is executable only after explicit selection; Preview
compatibility can still stop before a turn with a bounded configuration error.

The Grok, Kimi, Copilot, and Cursor rows record current official-documentation
research and pinned compatibility targets. Prompts are argv values and must not
be logged. Grok has an offline-fixture-verified one-shot bridge and one
representative authenticated native smoke. The other providers are Preview
adapters with common transports validated by fixtures; their vendor-specific
CLI and account combinations have not all been live-tested.

The optional `acp` and `mcp` extras install protocol SDK dependencies only:
`unified-cli[acp]` and `unified-cli[mcp]`. They do not activate another
provider or make a provider call.

## What promotion to an enabled integration requires

A future Stage 6 promotion is evaluated in an isolated environment for each
provider and version. Before a status can change, the project needs recorded,
repeatable evidence for:

- the exact vendor CLI install source and version;
- the observed authentication state and its user-visible behavior;
- prompt and output fixtures that establish the supported input/output form;
- cancellation and cleanup behavior, including what remains after an
  interrupted operation;
- permission behavior under the documented invocation; and
- session semantics, including how a session starts, continues, and ends.

This evidence is a compatibility gate, not a promise that a provider will be
promoted to Stable. Until it is complete and reviewed, the current runnable
entry remains Preview.

## Trust and ownership boundary

Extensions are installed Python code and run as trusted code in the host
Python process when loaded. Install only distributions you trust. Core owns
provider discovery and policy: extension providers must be explicitly
requested and are not selected by unprefixed model inference. The Core HTTP
server continues to reject extension providers at this stage.

For the Core extension ABI and trust boundary, see the
[provider plugin ABI](development/provider-plugin-abi-v1.md).
