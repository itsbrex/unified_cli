# Extensions changelog

This file records changes for the extension source tree bundled in `unified-cli`.
It is not the changelog of an independently published package.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.4] - 2026-07-24

- Promotes live-verified Grok and OpenCode to Stable for Python, CLI, and REPL,
  including models, images, tools, web, streaming, and sessions.
- Keeps the other 16 adapters executable as Preview and exposes callback-free
  default/capability metadata in provider menus.
- Prevents a wrong same-name Grok npm package from falling through to direct
  trust; the official native path remains pinned by path and digest.
- Keeps OpenCode browser chat disabled until inherited remote/system MCP
  startup can be positively suppressed.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-07-23

- Documents and regression-tests `from unified_cli import create` as the
  primary embedded API for every bundled Preview provider.
- Preserves sanitized authentication and usage-limit error kinds through the
  Core plugin boundary, including Grok's official unauthenticated JSON form
  and Pi's fixed no-auth RPC response.
- Refreshes version-probe contracts from current accountless official CLI
  evidence while retaining exact executable provenance and semver checks.
- Makes the complete Preview catalog visible in REPL and local manage surfaces
  without adding a second distribution or changing Core defaults.
- Records the accountless live result without broadening it: 13 current
  official installations reached `create()`, Cursor/Hermes/Mistral
  Vibe/Qoder had bounded compatibility blockers, and Poolside was not
  installed because EULA acceptance was not authorized.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-07-23

- Makes every one of the 18 bundled provider entry points an explicitly
  runnable Preview adapter. Grok has representative authenticated live-test
  evidence; the remaining provider families have offline transport fixtures
  and require vendor/account-specific compatibility reports.
- Adds safe lazy PATH resolution for direct executables and allowlisted npm
  launchers, plus bounded prompt-free diagnostic files and GitHub issue
  guidance for Preview failures.
- Keeps all extension providers explicit-only and disabled in HTTP server mode.
- Verifies every ACP interpreter/target prefix entry through spawn and excludes
  vendor stdout/stderr from persisted Preview diagnostics.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-07-23

- Consolidated the extension source into the single `unified-cli` distribution,
  exposing both `unified_cli` and `unified_cli_ext` namespaces without a second
  PyPI project.
- Kept Grok Preview, made Qoder/Kilo/Poolside Experimental, and retained the
  other 14 entries as Held metadata.
- Moved optional protocol installs to `unified-cli[acp]` and
  `unified-cli[mcp]`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-23

- Records a representative isolated device-code Grok native smoke: official
  `0.2.111` on macOS arm64, verified 2026-07-23. It covers direct chat,
  streaming/usage mapping, sessions and resume, invalid-model handling,
  cancellation, cleanup, and the public Core configuration path. The provider
  remains Preview and server-disabled; this is not broad compatibility evidence.

- Adds a server-disabled Grok Build Preview with fixed read-only agent tools,
  bounded official-CLI probes, streaming JSONL/session normalization, and
  offline regressions for malformed output, cancellation, and output limits;
  it requires exactly Grok `0.2.111`, fixes managed-MCP and gitignore-aware
  controls, requires an exact private safe config, and fails closed on project,
  provider-home, and managed system configuration. These controls are defense
  in depth, not a complete secret boundary. It is not Stable.
- Refreshes the Kimi Code CLI target to 0.29.0 while keeping Kimi, GitHub
  Copilot CLI, Cursor Agent CLI, and the other 14 catalog entries Held.

Initial extension-foundation release for `unified-cli` 0.5.x.

- Adds bounded JSONL, JSON-RPC, HTTP/SSE, process, normalization, permission,
  tool-correlation, and optional MCP/ACP runtime contracts.
- Adds a lazy macOS libc compatibility path for non-reaping child observation
  when the running Python does not expose `os.waitid`.
- Adds a caller-factory-free ACP 0.11 text-turn transport with fixed process
  ownership, cancellation, output limits, deterministic cleanup, and exact
  notification/response event ordering.
- Adds immutable local installation receipts for direct executables and scoped
  npm launchers. Receipts bind inspected local files; they do not establish
  publisher identity.
- Adds Held catalog metadata for Kimi, Copilot, Cursor, CodeBuddy, Mistral
  Vibe, Qwen, Cline, OpenCode, Factory Droid, Pi, Oh My Pi, Hermes Agent, Amp,
  and GitLab Duo CLI. These 14 entries remain unavailable until
  provider-specific compatibility evidence is completed and reviewed. Grok is
  a runnable Preview only through the explicit exact setup documented above;
  Qoder, Kilo Code, and Poolside Agent CLI are runnable Experimental
  integrations. All remain server-disabled, and none is Stable.
- Separates registry lifecycle from integration support status and generates
  the public support table from plugin metadata with a CI consistency check.
- Keeps extension identifiers explicit and lazy. Installing Ext does not change
  Core defaults or the Core server allowlist, handle provider credentials, or
  call a provider service.
- The `ext-v0.1.0` tag was an aborted publishing attempt. It did not publish an
  extension package to public PyPI and did not create a GitHub Release. The
  planned 0.5.2 unified distribution supersedes that split-release plan.
